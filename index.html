    <h2>Creative Thinker & Graphic Designer in the Making</h2>

    <p>
     I'm currently working on getting my Associates in Interactive & Graphic Design and I'd love to be an art director one day. I love to be in charge and have creative control. When I'm not working, I have many different artistic hobbies. I love jewlery making, reading, music, and bleach art on clothes. One fun fact about me is that one time someone donated me 1,000 Robux on Roblox for one of my drawings. I also assistant directed a fanmade music video this summer, feel free to check it out below. If you're interested in seeing some of my graphic design work, here's my digital portfolio!
